Makefile
--------
If you don't want to make each directory separately, just use this Makefile.
Either copy it to the top-level Sx3 directory, or create a symlink.  Then
cd to the top-level Sx3 directory and just type "make".

cvswrappers
-----------
CVS doesn't work to well with binary files.  To keep from accidentally checking
a binary file in using ascii mode, please copy cvswrappers to ~/.cvswrappers.
