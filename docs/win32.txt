Instructions for how to run sx3 on Win32
Please see mingw32.txt for how to compile.

1) Copy the files from the DLL directory to your windows system directory (either
   C:\windows\system or c:\winnt\system32, depending on your operating system)
2) Compile each module and run "make install", if you so desire (this has already
   been done for you).
3) cd to the sx3 directory and run sx3.exe.  It *must* be run out of the sx3 directory,
   or it will not be able to find the necessary data files.
