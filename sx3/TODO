This is a to do list for the Sx3 project.  Always grep for "FIX ME" and
"BUGBUG" in the sources.  Here's a list of other items that aren't addressed
elsewhere.

BUGS:
- The projectile being fired ALWAYS impacts with the shield.
- We don't tally up the damage until the end of the round.  This makes it difficult
  to determine which tank died first.

Optimizations:
- Break up the sx3_draw_terrain function so that it can be better profiled.
- Can we reduce the number of calls to glEnd/glBegin in sx3_draw_terrain?
- Should we be calling sx3_interpolated_terrain_point on every iteration of
  sx3_draw_terrain?  a) it seems as if this call is superfluous, and b) it seems
  that finding gl_norm before we need it is unnecessary.
- Use a vertex array; this reduces the number of vertices which the graphics card
  must juggle.  If not a vertex array, then please cache the return values from
  calculate_vertex_color et. al. so we can use them in the next iteration through
  the loop.
- Why recalculate temp_point and current_view_dir for every detail level?
- Use a display list for drawing the explosions.

High priority:
- Fire the projectiles from the correct angle, position, and power.
- Deform the terrain when an explosion hits.
- Write code for drawing and handling explosions and flightpaths for various
  projectile types.
- Get some tank models finished and textured.
- Load some tank models.

Med priority:
- Add support for an ini file; perhaps this should be in xml?
- Rewrite some of the code to use the sx3_global module.
- Write some GUI code and user interface code.
- Write code for an options menu and store menu.
- Allow the tanks to move around on the terrain.
- Use different viewpoints than what we currently have (which is klunky).

Low priority:
- Make terrain detail dependant on the distance the mouse moved.
- Write a function for generating terrain and incorporate it into the main program.
- Merge sx3_math.h with matrix.h, for uniformity.
- Move the console and terrain functions into separate libraries.
- Create a new title screen (that's not our tank).
- Draw water and sky.
- Create terrain textures (grass, snow, etc.)
- Generate our own sound effects (currently from www.sfx-gallery.co.uk).
- Compress our sound files (they are VERY big!)
- Play sounds during the flight of a projectile.
- Clean up the OpenGL code (specifically, write ONE routine for lighting).
- Use int instead of long int, where appropriate.
- Use float instead of double, where appropriate.
- Draw the explosions more creatively (and faster, since the current method entails
  about a 10fps hit).
- Connect detail levels in the terrain engine better (right now we see "spots").
- Replace (most) #defines with static inline functions or with static const
  variables (static inline functions conform to C94; static const variables
  conform to C89).

Trivial:
- Incorporate the gendir functionality into the program.
- Incorporate Marc's new console code and error handling code into the program.
